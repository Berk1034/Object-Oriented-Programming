## Task 1:
*"Introduction to the concepts of OOP: inheritance and polymorphism of types (virtual methods)"*  

*Build a class hierarchy for displaying graphic shapes: a segment, a rectangle, an ellipse, and so on - at least 6 shapes. Distribute classes by module. Create a list of shapes as a separate class. In the main module of the program add different figures to the list (static initialization), then start drawing a list of figures. For drawing use any suitable graphic library.*

## Task 2:
*"Graphic Editor"*

*Extend the example with graphic shapes so that shapes can be created at the user interface level. There are several ways: input of coordinates using the mouse, interactive input of values, input in the scripting language. The student can choose any input method. Creating an object should be done in such a way that adding a new class to the system does not require changing the existing code (the choice of type using the case / switch operator and multiple if cannot be done). The resulting program should be a primitive graphics editor. The shape classes should not contain a drawing method.*

## Task 3:
*"Serialization of objects"*

*Select a subject area and build a class hierarchy. The hierarchy must include at least 6 classes.
To implement serialization / deserialization of objects from the resulting class hierarchy to / from a file, the serialization format is determined by the individual variant.
In the user interface, you must implement the following functions:*
1. *Serialization / deserialization of the list of objects.*
*Data Structure according to the variant: JSON.
Adding new classes to the hierarchy should not lead to the need to rewrite existing code, and not to use if-else / switch-case, reflection.
Optional: implementation graphical interface.*
